# Kazador – AI Artist Management Platform

## Overview

**Kazador** is an AI-powered operational platform for artist management that transforms unstructured communications (email, meetings, voice notes) into a structured, timeline-first workspace. It automates email triage, surfaces critical actions through a Priority Engine, and enables managers to orchestrate complex touring, promotion, legal, and finance workflows with human-in-the-loop approval guardrails.

Built for artist managers like Oran who juggle dozens of shows, contracts, promo requests, and logistics across multiple artists and territories, Kazador replaces spreadsheet chaos with an intelligent, collaborative hub.

---

## Product Vision

Kazador turns the flood of emails, attachments, and meetings into a single source of truth:

- **Timeline Studio** – Multi-lane visual workspace showing Live, Promo, Writing, Brand, and Release operations with dependencies, conflicts, and travel buffers.
- **Priority Engine** – Scores tasks, emails, and timeline items by urgency, impact, dependencies, and proximity to events—no more rigid T-7/T-2 rules.
- **Project Hubs** – Self-contained contexts (e.g., "Asian Tour 2026") with scoped timelines, tasks, files, approvals, and metrics.
- **Playbooks** – Deterministic automation recipes that draft replies, propose calendar holds, file documents, and create tasks—always with approval gates for sensitive actions.
- **Today Digest** – Morning summary of top priorities, new leads, pending approvals, and project health across the entire workspace.

**Non-goals (MVP):** No auto-sending of legal/finance emails; no unapproved calendar confirmations; no public partner portal.

---

## Core Features

### 1. Email Triage & Classification

**What it does:**
- Connects to Gmail and classifies unread messages using a detailed taxonomy covering legal, finance, logistics, booking, promo, assets, and fan mail.
- Extracts entities (artist, venue, city, dates, fees) and enriches contact records.
- Applies Gmail labels (e.g., `Kazador/LEGAL/Contract_Draft`, `Kazador/artist/Barry_Cant_Swim`) for in-inbox visibility.
- Stores summaries, labels, and priority scores in Supabase.

**Primary labels** (one required per email):
- **LEGAL** – Contract_Draft, Contract_Executed, Addendum_or_Amendment, NDA_or_Clearance, Insurance_Indemnity, Compliance
- **FINANCE** – Settlement, Invoice, Payment_Remittance, Banking_Details, Tax_Docs, Expenses_Receipts, Royalties_Publishing
- **LOGISTICS** – Itinerary_DaySheet, Travel, Accommodation, Ground_Transport, Visas_Immigration, Technical_Advance, Passes_Access
- **BOOKING** – Offer, Hold_or_Availability, Confirmation, Reschedule_or_Cancel
- **PROMO** – Promo_Time_Request, Press_Feature, Radio_Playlist, Deliverables, Promos_Submission
- **ASSETS** – Artwork, Audio, Video, Photos, Logos_Brand, EPK_OneSheet
- **FAN** – Support_or_Thanks, Request, Issues_or_Safety
- **MISC** – Uncategorized

**Cross-tag prefixes** (optional, applied alongside primary labels):
- `artist/{name}`, `project/{slug}`, `territory/{ISO2}`, `city/{name}`, `venue/{name}`, `date/{YYYY-MM-DD}`, `tz/{IANA}`, `approval/{type}`, `confidential/{flag}`, `status/{state}`, `assettype/{kind}`, `risk/{flag}`

**Implementation:**
- Worker: `worker/src/index.ts`, `worker/src/classifyEmail.ts`
- AI analysis: `shared/src/analyzeEmail.ts` (OpenAI with retry/backoff)
- Heuristic fallback: `shared/src/heuristicLabels.ts`
- Dashboard: `app/components/EmailDashboard.tsx`
- API: `app/app/api/email-stats/route.ts`, `app/app/api/emails/route.ts`, `app/app/api/classify-emails/route.ts`

### 2. Project Hubs (Workspace Isolation + Context Graph)

**What it does:**
- Creates top-level project containers (e.g., "Asian Tour 2026", "Barry Cant Swim – SHEE Release") that own timelines, tasks, files, and emails while sharing a global data graph.
- Enables deliberate linking of Drive folders, email threads, and calendar events to projects.
- Derives labels from connected sources (e.g., folder path `/JP/` → `territory=JP`).
- Suggests email-to-project attachments when confidence is high (venue/city/date match, thread participants, folder mentions).

**Project Hub tabs:**
- **Overview** – Summary, KPIs, top priorities (from Priority Engine), upcoming key dates, progress bars
- **Timeline** – Scoped multi-lane view with dependencies, conflicts, holds, and milestones
- **Inbox** – Emails linked to this project plus AI suggestions
- **Tasks** – To-dos with statuses, assignees, and due dates
- **Files & Assets** – Connected Drive folders, canonical assets (logos, EPK), asset links
- **People** – Contacts and orgs most active in this project
- **Approvals** – Pending approvals for email links, timeline items, label suggestions
- **Settings** – Labels/metadata, color, date range, templates, sources

**Templates:**
Creating a project from a template (e.g., "Tour Leg", "Single Release", "Festival Weekend") seeds standard timeline items, dependencies, and checklists.

**Implementation:**
- API: `app/app/api/projects/route.ts`, `app/app/api/project-templates/route.ts`
- Components: `app/components/projects/ProjectCard.tsx`, `app/components/projects/ProjectCreateDialog.tsx`
- Project Hub: `app/app/(protected)/projects/[projectId]/page.tsx`
- Timeline Studio: `app/components/projects/TimelineStudio.tsx`
- Files: `app/components/projects/FilesTab.tsx`
- Suggestions: `shared/src/projectSuggestions.ts`, `app/app/api/projects/suggestions/email/route.ts`
- Worker jobs: `worker/src/projectJobs.ts` (computes metrics, suggestions, approvals)

### 3. Timeline Studio

**What it does:**
- Multi-lane visual timeline per artist with lanes for **Live, Promo, Writing, Brand/Partnerships, Release-ops**.
- Supports item types: events (shows, interviews), milestones (deliver artwork), tasks, holds, offers/leads, release gates (upload draft, publish, send-out).
- Models dependencies: finish-to-start (FS), start-to-start (SS); visualizes blockers; detects circular dependencies.
- Conflict detection: flags calendar overlaps, travel feasibility issues (configurable buffer windows), and territory jumps.
- Priority computation: Priority Engine scores items by urgency × impact × confidence × dependencies × calendar proximity.
- Views: filter by category, territory, date range (next 7/14/30 days), per project/release, per contact/org.
- Versioning & snapshots: capture timeline state for sharing or historical comparison; diff two snapshots.
- Sharing: generate read-only links or export to Google Doc/Sheet.

**Implementation:**
- Component: `app/components/projects/TimelineStudio.tsx`
- Conflict detection: `shared/src/timelineConflicts.ts`
- Priority scoring: `shared/src/projectPriority.ts`
- Database: `timeline_items`, `timeline_dependencies` tables (see schema)

### 4. Priority Engine & Today Digest

**What it does:**
- Replaces rigid T-7/T-2 risk horizons with a flexible scoring algorithm.
- **Inputs:** due date, event start, dependency chain (blocking others?), impact (user-set weight per item type), confidence (classification certainty), calendar density (overlaps), SLA targets, user pins/snoozes.
- **Output:** priority score (0–100) + rationale.
- **Behavior:** Top actions bubble up on dashboard and timeline views; snoozing or completing updates score in real time.
- **Config:** per-artist weights and rules; quick presets (Travel-heavy Week, Release Week, Touring Off-Week).

**Today Digest (08:00 Europe/London):**
- Priority summary for the day; new leads; holds awaiting approval; yesterday's meeting outcomes; release updates.
- Optional Telegram TL;DR with Approve/Reject buttons (future).
- Web view at `/today` inside the Next.js app.
- Scheduled worker job: `npm --prefix worker run digest`.

**Implementation:**
- Priority Engine: `shared/src/projectPriority.ts`
- Digest job: `worker/src/digestJob.ts`
- Today Dashboard: `app/components/today/TodayDashboard.tsx`, `app/app/(protected)/today/page.tsx`
- API: `app/app/api/digests/route.ts`
- Database: `user_preferences`, `digests`, `action_logs` tables

### 5. Playbooks & Autopilot Policy

**What they are:**
Deterministic automation recipes with clear inputs/outputs and an autopilot policy (Auto / Draft-Only / Notify). Playbooks draft next steps for key labels (legal, settlements, logistics/promo) but never act alone on sensitive topics.

**Example Playbooks:**

| Playbook | Trigger | Actions | Policy |
|----------|---------|---------|--------|
| **Booking Enquiry** | BOOKING/Offer email | Extract venue/date/fee → enrich → brand-fit score → create lead → optional hold → folder scaffold → reply draft → add to timeline | Draft-Only |
| **Promo Time Request** | PROMO/Promo_Time_Request | Slot proposal (routing-aware) → tentative hold → press kit → reply draft → timeline item | Draft-Only (Auto later) |
| **Promos Submission** | PROMO/Promos_Submission | Capture links → listening queue → acknowledgement → optional listening tasks | Auto for ack; Draft-Only for personalized |
| **Logistics Update** | LOGISTICS/Itinerary_DaySheet | Parse itinerary/rider → update event/checklists → file docs → mark blockers | Draft-Only/Notify |
| **Assets Request** | ASSETS/* email | Attach canonical assets → reply draft → log distribution → timeline annotation | Auto if unambiguous |
| **Finance/Settlement** | FINANCE/Settlement | Extract amounts/due → reminders → timeline tasks | Draft-Only; legal/finance guardrails |
| **Meeting Ingest** | Zoom/Meet recording | Transcribe/summarise → tasks → file → attach to timeline | Auto ingest; Notify for sensitive |
| **Voice Memo** | Telegram voice note | Transcribe/normalise → task/note/doc → timeline/backlog | Auto |
| **Track Report Builder** | New assets in Drive | Build/refresh track report → update release lane | Auto |
| **SoundCloud Uploader** | ASSETS/Audio + release gate | Create private draft; metadata; approval to publish | Draft-Only; Auto for draft creation |
| **Promo Send-Out** | Release gate: Send-Outs | Generate list + drafts; throttle; add follow-ups to timeline | Draft-Only |
| **Promo Feedback Collector** | Replies to send-outs | Parse replies; update supporters/quotes; timeline annotations | Auto ingest |

**Guardrails:**
- Domain/keyword blacklists (legal/finance/confidential)
- Confidence thresholds
- Per-artist tone kits
- All outbound email: Draft-Only by default

**Implementation:**
- Approvals: `app/app/api/approvals/route.ts`, `app/lib/approvalActions.ts`

- **Never-act-alone guardrails:** All outbound email Draft-Only by default; domain/keyword blacklists for legal/finance/confidential; confidence thresholds; per-artist tone kits
- **Approvals workflow:** High-sensitivity actions (legal, finance, settlements) require explicit approval before execution
- **Audit logs:** `action_logs` table tracks user actions, entity changes, diffs
- **Confidential flags:** Assets and emails can be flagged as confidential; restricts visibility and sharing
