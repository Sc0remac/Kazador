## 1. Repository overview
Kazador is organised as a TypeScript monorepo using npm workspaces. There are three first-class packages:

| Package | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `app/` | Next.js 14 web application that exposes dashboards for email triage, project hubs, the Today digest, and admin tooling. |
| `worker/` | Node.js background workers that ingest Gmail, apply classification via OpenAI plus heuristics, enrich Supabase, refresh project metrics, and build a priority digest. |
| `shared/` | Reusable TypeScript domain utilities and types shared by both the frontend and workers (email taxonomy, label helpers, priority engine, timeline conflict detection, etc.). |

The root `package.json` wires workspace build/test scripts and pins Node 20+. `node_modules/` at the repo root hosts shared dependencies such as React, Vitest, and testing libraries.

## 2. Top-level workspace assets
- `.gitignore`, `.nvmrc` – standard tooling defaults.
- `README.md` – high-level product introduction, setup guides, Supabase schema summary, and worker/dashboard run instructions.
- `schema_final.sql` – comprehensive Supabase schema (auth, storage, realtime, application tables for projects, tasks, emails, digests, approvals, assets, etc.). Use it as the canonical migration reference.
- `Project Overview.txt`, `Project Roadmap.txt`, `Contact Enrichment.txt`, `Oran Responses.txt` – narrative design and planning notes that expand on the Kazador vision.
- Root npm scripts (`build`, `dev`, `test`, etc.) orchestrate package-level scripts via `npm --prefix`.

## 3. Application package (`app/`)
Next.js 14 App Router project with Tailwind CSS styling. Uses Supabase auth on the client and server.

### 3.1 Routes and layouts (`app/app/`)
- `layout.tsx` – Root layout applying global fonts/styles and mounting the `AuthProvider`.
- `(auth)/login/page.tsx` – Public login form using `LoginForm` to sign in with Supabase email/password.
- `(protected)/layout.tsx` – Suspense-wrapped guard that enforces authentication (`AuthGuard`) and renders `AppShell` navigation.
- `(protected)/page.tsx` – Home route delegating to `HomeDashboard`.
- `(protected)/inbox/page.tsx` – Inbox surface embedding `EmailDashboard` to inspect classified mail with priority zones, explainability overlays, and rule-driven action buttons.
- `(protected)/settings/priorities/page.tsx` – Priority control centre with preset catalog, impact previews, advanced boosts/action rules editor, and scheduled preset switching.
- `(protected)/today/page.tsx` – Today digest view via `TodayDashboard`.
- `(protected)/projects/page.tsx` – Project listing, search, status filters, creation dialog.
- `(protected)/profile/page.tsx` – Profile management UI (calls Supabase to edit metadata & Drive integration).
- `(protected)/admin/page.tsx` – Admin console with panels for workspace data, projects, users.
- `(protected)/logout/page.tsx` – Sign-out helper (leverages auth context).
- API routes under `app/app/api/` (all `GET`/`POST` handlers run in the Edge Node runtime and require bearer auth):
  - `email-stats` – Aggregates counts of unread/all emails per Kazador label using Supabase, ensuring default taxonomy coverage.
  - `emails` – Paginates email records with optional label/source filters and returns metadata & attachments.
  - `classify-emails` – Triggers the worker classification endpoint for manual reruns.
  - `projects` – Lists projects with joined membership/roles and supports text/status filters.
  - `project-templates` – Serves reusable project templates and seeds new `project_items` with default lanes/types.
  - `project-approvals`/`approvals` – Exposes approval records for the Today digest & admin review.
  - `digests` – Returns current digest payload and history snapshots.

Global stylesheet lives at `app/app/globals.css`.

### 3.2 React components (`app/components/`)
The component library is grouped by feature area:
- `AppShell`, `AuthGuard`, `AuthProvider`, `LoginForm` – authentication context, protected routing, layout chrome, sign-in workflow.
- `EmailDashboard` – priority-zoned card layout with explainability breakdowns, configurable action buttons, snooze slate, Gmail launch, stats polling, pagination, and label/source filters with 60s refresh cadence.
- `home/HomeDashboard` – high-level digest summary, top priorities, upcoming deadlines, seeded email feed.
- `today/TodayDashboard` – rich Today digest including historical runs, per-project metrics, approvals, top actions.
- `projects/` – project cards, creation dialog, Timeline Studio (week/day focus, lane filters, conflict overlays), files tab for asset management.
- `admin/` – admin dashboard/panels for inspecting seeded data, project registries, user provisioning.
- `ProfileDriveIntegration`, `ProfileTimelinePreferences` (if present) – account integrations & preferences.
- Component test stubs live under `app/components/__tests__/`.

### 3.3 Frontend libraries (`app/lib/`)
Utility modules and API clients:
- `supabaseClient.ts` – fetch helpers for email stats, email lists, projects, digest data, approvals, assets; normalises pagination objects and interfaces with the `timeline_entries` view plus the project item CRUD endpoints.
- `supabaseBrowserClient.ts` / `serverSupabase.ts` / `serverAuth.ts` – Supabase client factories and bearer token verification used in API handlers.
- `adminAuth.ts`, `projectAccess.ts`, `projectMappers.ts` – gatekeeping & mapping helpers for admin/project APIs.
- `approvalActions.ts` – mutate approval state (approve/decline) and emit audit logs.
- `googleOAuth.ts`, `googleDriveClient.ts`, `driveIndexer.ts` – Google integrations for Drive file surfacing.
- `auditLog.ts` – structured audit logging utilities.
- `__tests__/` – Vitest suites covering API utilities.

### 3.4 Configuration & tooling
- `package.json` / `package-lock.json` – Next.js, Tailwind, Supabase, Google APIs dependencies.
- `tsconfig.json`, `tailwind.config.js`, `postcss.config.js` – TypeScript & styling config.
- `node_modules/` – app-specific dependencies.

## 4. Shared package (`shared/`)
Pure TypeScript library compiled for consumption across packages.
- `src/types.ts` – canonical domain types (emails, contacts, projects, tasks, project items, approvals, digests, assets, taxonomy constants, helper enums).
- `analyzeEmail.ts` – orchestrates OpenAI email summarisation with retry/backoff, taxonomy guardrails, playbook instructions, subject/body normalisation, label sanitisation.
- `heuristicLabels.ts` – rule-based label detection used as fallback or for quick classification.
- `labelUtils.ts` – normalisation helpers, default coverage (ensures at least primary label), selection of primary category.
- `projectPriority.ts` – scoring algorithm for project top actions combining urgency, dependencies, buffers, risk; now consumes `project_items` priorities and shared lane/type metadata.
- `timelineConflicts.ts` – detects schedule conflicts given territory jumps, travel buffers, overlapping items.
- `projectSuggestions.ts` – heuristics to attach incoming emails to existing projects or suggest new ones.
- `projectPriority`, `analyzeEmail`, `heuristicLabels` all have Vitest unit suites under `__tests__/`.
- `index.ts` re-exports all modules for convenient `@kazador/shared` imports.

## 5. Worker package (`worker/`)
Node-based background services that operate against Gmail and Supabase.
- `src/index.ts` – Gmail poller:
  - Authenticates via OAuth refresh token.
  - Lists unread messages (configurable `MAX_EMAILS_TO_PROCESS`).
  - Fetches bodies, decodes MIME parts, extracts headers.
  - Reads cached summaries/labels from Supabase, calls `classifyEmail` (using shared AI + heuristics), writes contacts/emails back to Supabase, applies Gmail labels (`Kazador/...`).
- `classifyEmail.ts` – orchestrates summary/label reuse, AI calls, heuristic fallback, coverage enforcement; returns metadata on caching vs AI usage.
- `digestJob.ts` – builds the "Today" digest:
  - Pulls projects, tasks, project items via `timeline_entries`, approvals, emails.
  - Maps rows to shared types, computes metrics, stores digests & preferences.
- `projectJobs.ts` – refreshes per-project metrics (open tasks, timeline counts, linked emails, sources, members) and writes aggregated profiles plus suggestions for linking emails to projects; timeline metrics now expect the `project_items` source.
- `projectSuggestions` usage ensures email-project linking.
- `__tests__/classifyEmail.test.ts` covers classification behaviour.
- `package.json` / `tsconfig.json` configure the worker build (`tsc`) and runtime scripts (`npm run build`, `npm start`, `npm run digest`).

## 6. Database & migrations
`schema_final.sql` defines the full Supabase/Postgres setup:
- Supabase auth schemas/extensions (auth, storage, realtime, vault, etc.).
- Application tables: `contacts`, `emails`, `projects`, `project_tasks`, `project_items`, view `timeline_entries`, `timeline_dependencies`, `project_members`, `project_sources`, `project_email_links`, `project_item_links`, `assets`, `asset_links`, `approvals`, `digests`, `user_preferences`, `action_logs`, supporting indexes & RLS policies.
- Use this file to recreate the database locally or seed Supabase.

## 7. Testing & quality
- Root `vitest.config.ts` scopes test discovery to each package and configures React aliases.
- `vitest.setup.ts` loads Testing Library matchers and polyfills `URLSearchParams.size`.
- Run `npm test` from the repo root to execute all package tests with Vitest.

## 8. Environment & runtime expectations
- Node.js ≥ 20 (see `.nvmrc`).
- Supabase environment variables:
  - `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` for workers.
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` for the frontend.
- Gmail/OAuth for worker ingestion: `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`, `GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI` (optional), `GMAIL_REFRESH_TOKEN`.
- OpenAI for classification: `OPENAI_API_KEY` (plus optional retry tunables used in `shared/analyzeEmail`).
- Worker jobs read optional `MAX_EMAILS_TO_PROCESS` to limit batch size.

## 9. Reference documents
Keep the supporting strategy docs in mind when extending functionality:
- `Project Overview.txt` – product narrative and feature framing.
- `Project Roadmap.txt` – milestone planning, backlog ideas.
- `Contact Enrichment.txt` – requirements for contact sync & dedupe.
- `Oran Responses.txt` – stakeholder Q&A guiding UX & automation decisions.

With this guide, contributors should be able to navigate the codebase, identify the right package for their change, and understand how frontend, worker, and shared utilities collaborate.
